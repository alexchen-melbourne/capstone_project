## 1. Backgroud Description


### 1.1 Problem Statement

Melbourne has become the most liveable city all over the world for 7 years. As an important part of living in Melbourne, housing market is also getting increasingly attention. In this research, I will discuess below questions:

- What is the house price distribution in different suburb?
- Compared 3 or more bedrooms houses, are 1 or 2 bedrooms houses more popular in Melbourne?
- Is there a reasonable model I can build to predict house price based on limited features?
  
### 1.2 Potential Audience

- Housing market agency
- Potential buyers

### 1.3 Goals

- Examining house price distribution in different suburb.
- Examining house price distribution in different number of bedrooms house.
- Build a model to predict house price.

### 1.4 Success Metrics

- For training/testing split model validation, reach to 80% positive recognition on testing data.
